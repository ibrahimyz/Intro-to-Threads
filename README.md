# Intro-to-Threads

This repository includes basic multithreading examples written in C using **POSIX threads (pthreads)**. The goal is to demonstrate how to create threads, pass data to them, and manage their execution and memory safely. These examples are designed for learning and practice purposes.

## Compilation & Usage

Make sure you have `gcc` and `pthread` support installed.
